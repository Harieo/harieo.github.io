    <h1>Hi, my name is <span id="intro-name">Harieo</span> and I'm a <span id="intro-text">%occupation%</span></h1>
    <div class="about-me">
        <h4>A little bit about me...</h4>
        <p>
            There's not much to know about me. I'm a self-taught programmer who does work both professionally and as a
            hobby. I started learning when I was younger and expanded my knowledge through the years into other
            languages.
            My main programming language is Java, it's the first one I learned and what I go to when I need server-side
            integrations making. I also know JavaScript, HTML and CSS which is what I'm using to bring you this web
            page.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm an enthusiast for all types of languages and I speak French which I studied in college. Always learning!
        </p>
        <br/>

        <h4>How do I work?</h4>
        <p>
            I take on projects based on multiple factors which include, but aren't limited to, my availability, whether
            the project is suitable for my skill set and the scale of the project.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Availability</b> depends on any projects I've taken on before yours and any other
            obligations I may have in my personal life. I won't take on a project that
            I can't complete and will inform clients of any delays that may occur during coding.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Suitability</b> depends on whether your project will require any mechanics or techniques that I'm not
            capable of providing you. I don't know everything and will do my best
            to ensure your project is completed to an acceptable standard. If I can't fulfil this, I will reject the
            project outright.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Scale</b> depends on the sheer amount of work your project would require and the resources it will take
            to complete. This is something I'd personally discuss with a client to get
            a clear understanding of the complexity and scale of the project, which would allow me to assess whether I
            will be able to dedicate the resources to completing it. This also ties
            in with my availability, the longer the project will take, the more available I will need to make myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once a project is accepted, we will come up with a design and requirements for the project to make sure it
            will be completed how you would like it. After all this, the coding can
            finally begin and I will provide demonstrations on the progress of the project at stages where appropriate.
            More details will be given upon a project being accepted.
        </p>
